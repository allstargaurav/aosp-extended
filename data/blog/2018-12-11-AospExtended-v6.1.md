#### There are a lot of things we did for Pie releases. Here, to list them:

---

- We have revamped our download website!
  A new layout which will have both Pie as well as Oreo (Latest build) builds. Note that older Oreo builds to be up on this portal will depend on the maintainers.
  [Download Center](https://downloads.aospextended.com)

- We have updated the procedure for the application of official devices.
  Do check our [Documenation repo](https://github.com/AospExtended/Documentation_and_thread-template) out for the updated readmes and rules.
