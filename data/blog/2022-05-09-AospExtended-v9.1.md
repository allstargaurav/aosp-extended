- Initial release based on Android Twelve L with the May security patch!

After a long break we are pushing official releases based on the latest android twelve L source. We hope you guys are doing good and are making the best use of your time. This release was a bit slower than our previous releases because all of us are a little busy at this point of time. We hope you guys respect our decision and we are all grateful for your support.

Maintainers have been informed about the release and builds will be available for officially supported devices very soon. We have 3 new devices coming up this release, the OnePlus Nord 2 5G (denniz), Redmi 5 Plus (vince) and the Redmi Note 10 (mojito/sunny).

Thanks, as always.
