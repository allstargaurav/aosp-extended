With this release, we really want to apologise to our users for the delay in the update. With our core developers being tied up to their personal life & space we were not able to match our consistency. But this is life and it was going to happen someday or the other. This release has a lot of improvements internally and we have focused on providing stability to our users. However, the Sysserv support for Substratum theme engine might have few minor issues because it is still not stable (as per substartum devs), it is because of the high demand of users that we have merged it.

We have been consistent for about two years straight and it is all because of the love & support we get from our users. After this release, we are looking forward to refactor our release pattern a bit so that we are not bound by any time constraints as such. Thanks again for the support you have been giving us, we are looking forward to our next releases.
