Happy March everyone! We are finally coming up with our official release of AOSP Extended v8.0! It is based on Android 11, and it will have the basic goodies for you all. Once again I'd like to mention that it is our initial release, so it will take some time to get on with all the features. We hope you guys will enjoy it!

Maintainers have been informed about the release and builds will be available for officially supported devices very soon!

About Generic System Images, we have been working on it and in coming weeks the support will be added and images will be released on our downloads website and telegram channel.

Once again, we would like to thank the android community and our users for their patience and continuous support. It will soon be 5 years in the android journey for us. Love to everyone!
