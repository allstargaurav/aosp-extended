Wishing our lead developer @ishubhamsingh a very happy birthday. It's been a privilege to work with you man. Loads of love ❤️

One more thing, we would like to tell our users with this update that our website has been down temporarily. So we have moved our download website to a temporary server. So there might be few issues. There is no ETA when this will be fixed, but we will try to fix that as soon as possible.

Thank you.
