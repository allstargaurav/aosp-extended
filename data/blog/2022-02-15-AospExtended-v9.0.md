Our love for android is never ending and this is shown by our continuous support to the android community. Since, Valentine's Day is over; we are excited to announce our 6th android release - AOSP Extended 9!. This will be our 6th continuous year, in the android community. Based on the fresh android twelve, with fluid and customizable experience. We hope you guys will enjoy the new UI/UX experience and we are excited to hear you back!

This will be the first release based on android twelve and we have tried our best to put in a lot of features in this first release so you that guys won't miss our goodies.

Maintainers have been informed about the release and builds will be available for officially supported devices very soon!
