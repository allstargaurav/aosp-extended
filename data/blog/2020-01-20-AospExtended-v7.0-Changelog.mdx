Happy January everyone! How is everybody? We are finally coming up with our latest release - AOSP Extended 7! Based on the latest iteration of Android – Android Ten (Or shall we stick to Queencake?). This is our initial release so, it is not going to have all the features from our previous release but it still has all the basic customisation. We have also merged the latest security patch and everything is stable as it should be! We hope you enjoy our little “New Year” gift!

Maintainers have been informed about the release and builds will be available for officially supported devices very soon!

We would like to thank the android community and our users for their patience and continuous support. Good things take time as always!

Thank you.
